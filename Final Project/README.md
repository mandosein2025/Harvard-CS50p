# Face Recognition Security System

#### Video Demo:  <(https://youtu.be/svjGIUoibZQ)>

#### Description: This Python project uses DeepFace, OpenCV, and pyttsx3 to create a simple face recognition security system. The program captures frames from a webcam and checks if a face is present.

If the face matches a known person in the database, the program waits 5 seconds and then greets the person with a voice message, e.g., “Welcome Mohammad Hosein”.

If the face is not recognized or no face is detected, the frame is saved in the unauthorized_faces folder with the current date and time as the file name. A voice message says “Unauthorized access”.

The program runs entirely in the terminal, printing messages and using text-to-speech for alerts. This makes it simple, lightweight, and easy to use.

This project can be used for learning face recognition, Python programming, and building security systems for doors, computers, or other restricted areas.
